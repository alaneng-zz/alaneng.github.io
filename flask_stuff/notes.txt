Learnings with Flask & Bootstrap:

Bootstrap is simply a folder with css files
In order to get Bootstrap to work, link it in your <head>:

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css" />

You must have it in /static folder in order for Flask to recognize that filepath and serve it

To run Bootstrap, simply indicate the class name in your html:
  <div class="container">
    yoyo
  </div>

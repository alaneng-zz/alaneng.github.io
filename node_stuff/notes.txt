Node is a library you're already using

When you write your web app, you're using node.js because the very fact that you're composing javascript outside the browser is something that node.js provides. 

You can start a web server by writing this:

var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(request, response){
  console.log('got a request!');
  response.write('heyyy');
  response.end();
});

server.listen(3000)

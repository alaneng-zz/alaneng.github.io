## Settlers of Catan Tracker
Do you ever wonder whether your dice are fair? At the end of any Settlers game, you should expect to have rolled a lot more 6, 7, and 8s than 2, 11, and 12s. Use this app to keep track of each roll and see how the distribution appears in the end! If it's not normal, then I have bad news for your dice...
